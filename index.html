          <h2>What Do I Teach?</h2>
          <p class="pt-3">Students can use Live Online service to work with their tutor; 
            this can provide continuity of education when a student is on holiday or additional 
            support is needed outside of the timetabled tuition lesson.<br><br> Live Online is often used as the main method of tuition.  
            Students – particularly those in university and A level candidates love it; sometimes parents 
            take a little longer to be convinced by the idea. Rest assured that as is the case with my service ethos, 
            you will have an experienced consultant who will work with you to ensure tuition is tailored to 
            achieving your child’s educational goals. </p>

              <p class="pt-3">
                From the basics of reading, writing, comprehension or spelling, to debating, analysing and critical writing there are so many 
                vital parts of English literature and language which, maybe through illness, absence or other factor, have developed into a lack of understanding. 
                This will limit your child in reaching its full potential across many subjects.<br><br> 
                When you hire a tutor you are employing a specialist teacher to provide a truly bespoke service to your child. Your Tutor is the best in their field at what they teach, 
                affording you peace of mind that your child is receiving the quality 1-to-1 tuition they need.

              <p class="pt-3">
                Science, a core subject available in combined sciences or in detail through a focus on biology, chemistry or physics.<br><br>
                The skills and knowledge the sciences provide are able to develop an understanding of more complex issues and provide evidence-based 
                formulas and experiments to be conducted, researched and reported. 
                These skills are often vital throughout the entire curriculum and tutor to ensure the network consists of those that are delivering best-practices 
                teaching methods in a style to suit your requirements.

              <p class="pt-3">
                Maths study can be a challenge at the best of times. Often they just need additional support. 
                But as a parent you know how hard it can be juggling busy lives with homework, and still finding quality time for family. 
                Lots of people think they don’t have ‘a mind for maths.’ <br><br>I have experience and qualifications to deliver in-depth, specialist maths knowledge in 
                complex areas like algebra, equations, geometry, scientific maths and probabilities – core topics that impact exam results at every level.

              <p class="pt-3">
                History, a subject that we all understand to be imperative to acknowledge and understand, 
                a foundation on which to base all learning and knowledge. This can be hard for younger children to comprehend, 
                from navigating the intricacies of the civil wars in the 
                British Wars of the Roses through to modern day and world history. 
                The events that have happened allow context and understanding of the complex world in which we live. 
                i have a range of specialist history teachers that can go into the depth of knowledge required across all the main topics involved in the subject.
