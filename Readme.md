# Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
 * First Time Visitor Goals

    i. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the tutor.

      a. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily        
        readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a image with Text and a "Book a lesson" Call to action button which will redirect to contact page.

      b. Next there are the subjects I teach with a Call to action button which will redirects to learn more about the tutor.

    ii. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout    
        the site to find content.

      a. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of  
        each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.

      b. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure      the  user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
            
      c. On the Contact Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    iii. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users 
         think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

        a. Once the new visitor has read the About page and What I Do text, they will notice the qualification and use of online service.

        b. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media 
           links in the footer.

        c. At the bottom of the Contact page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the person on social media which highlights the links to them.

 *  Frequent User Goals

      i. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added reviews about the tutor.

        a. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check the reviews section.

    ii. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new subjects are added.

        a. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily check the subjects.
